            <h3>Finest Indian Culinary</h3>
            <p>A Guide To Indian Cuisine
                Indian cuisine is meant to be eaten socially, in groups, until everyone is fully satisfied. You will be served all your courses at once on a plate of food called a thali. A thali is a large tray that is used to serve all the foods at once. Some foods are mild, sweet and some are spicy and hot. Most dinners are served later at night since many Indians eat several smaller meals during the day. The food ranges from very simple vegetarian fare to exotic dishes layered with texture and flavor. Great care is taken in the planning and preparation of meals no matter how simple or complex.</p>

        <h3>Delectable Chinese Cuisine</h3>
        <p>China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth, managing to evolve through last 4 millennia as the leader of the Asian continent in terms of not only developing new technologies, but also expanding their influence that touched not only religion, fashion, and customs, but also cuisine.

            By being one of the first Asian civilizations that achieved stability and regular growth, China very quickly managed to acquire very specific taste in food that enabled its cuisine to grow and change with incredible pace. This great attention to food can today be attributed to several factors that enabled Chinese cooks to create the most diverse and interesting cuisine in the world quick expansion of the Han culture from Yellow River across entire territory of China that covers many climate zones that have their own indigenous ingredients and cooking traditions, constant absorption of foreign cuisine traditions via trading connection or expansions, very popularized movement that infused herbal medicine with cooking making meal preparation very balanced and healthy, and finally never-ending cooking fashion changes that were forced by imperial courts and Chinese elites.</p>
